# Sorting Algorithm Racer

## Description

Sorting Algorithm Racer is a visual tool designed to race multiple sorting algorithms side-by-side on the same dataset. This allows users to understand their performance and behavior through real-time animations. It provides an engaging and interactive way to learn about the efficiency and characteristics of different sorting algorithms.

## Motive

The primary motive behind this project is to make learning sorting algorithms fun, visual, and interactive. By comparing how different algorithms perform on the same input, users can gain a deeper understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. This hands-on approach enhances learning and retention compared to traditional methods.

## Features and Working

*   **Visual Race:** The application visually races algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and more.
*   **Real-time Sorting Animations:** Provides real-time animations of the sorting process, making it easy to follow the steps each algorithm takes.
*   **Adjustable Speed and Array Size:** Users can adjust the speed of the animations and the size of the array being sorted to observe the algorithms under different conditions.
*   **Highlighting:** Highlights elements being compared and swapped, making it clear which operations are being performed at each step.
